# Hi Tanya!

I set up a couple of files for you to work on.
You'll need to do a few things to get started.

## Project Initialization

-   Fork and Clone this repository
-   cd into the directory
-   run the command `git checkout -b tanya-prado` to create a new branch
-   run the command `npm i` to install the necessary dependencies:

    ## Instructions

    -   Once you feel like you have a working solution for a problem, run the command `npm test <file name>`
    -   Hit me up for questions and hints after being stuck for at minimum 10 minutes and max 20 okie?
    -   Make sure to commit after every single problem you solve, this is good practice.
    -   Make a pull request after that first commit
